- I made a luminance test bench for push buttons of the Flight Control Unit of Airbus aircraft. It includes the electronics card, and the software. We had two versions one working on Raspberry Pi, one using a computer using a FTDI card to convert USB to I2C.
- I did a software to control the HP 4142B which is a modular DC Source/Monitor and allows to analyse electronic components. Indeed, this analyser is very good, but very old and hard to control without a modern software. My software was controlling the HP 4142B using GPIB protocol. With this software, I create an algorithm which allows to determine if a diode is respecting the datasheet.
- I also did a software which allows to control a logical analyser using the GPIB protocol. This software can program memory.
