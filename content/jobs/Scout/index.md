- Engineering degree
- We went further with the learning of c++.
- I learnt how to use Docker, and we had a small school project on it.
- I learnt more about database development with the language SQL, then noSQL.
- I learnt more about Machine Learning. I used the K-nearest neighbour, the neural network, the convolution neural network and the cascade classifier.
- I learnt about combinatorial optimisation algorithms in particular the implementation of the genetic algorithm on a problem.
- I learnt about real-time programming by using multi-threading, inter-thread communication, process management, inter process communication, mutex, and scheduling algorithms.
- I did a car robot which was controlled thought internet on a web page. It had also an automatic mode: the robot was able to perform special action when it recognized digits. All of this throughout a PiCamera using a Raspberry Pi 4 8 Go, CNN algorithm for AI and TCP/IP for connection to the robot.
- I had an introduction to cyber security with system administration with Windows AD, a lot of lesson on linux and apply cryptography (we had to build a full certification cascade to certify a web server).
- With classmate, we did a YouTube like platform, using python, Flask and SQLAlchemy using Git and Gitlab for project management.
- I learnt the base of VHDL on FPGA.
- I did a crypted serial communication protocol RS485 one master to eight slaves (maximum) using C language and OpenSSL library in C.
