- I made a dashcam using a Raspberry Pi 3b+, Pi Camera, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and GNSS. With an Android application, you could launch the recorded data, and at the end of the trip you could visualize it on your phone.
- With this experience of this proof of concept, I became project manager of a team of three persons, to develop a production dashcam for car instructors based on Raspberry Pi. We did this project with Swift Navigation and Deutsch Telekom for a call to project.
- I worked with Machine Learning to find road incidents like run a stop sign or a red light, safe distances not respected, speeding on a commercial dashcam based on an Android application.
