I create a POC for a dashcam based on Raspberry Pi controlled by a phone app. With my team, we create a full version dashcam controlled by an app, in partnership with Swift Navigation and Deutsch Telekom. It allows to record the video, the GPS position, acceleration and send those data to a server. The teacher could mark on the app each driving incidents. After the driving lesson, the teacher and the student could rewatch the trip especially where the teacher puts the marks.
